# Task 1: Reverse a String
# (HINT: Review the Algorithms + Problem Solving Lecture!)
# Write code that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed
# i.e. “Hello” will be returned as “olleH”

word="Christmas"

# word[0] is "C"
# word[1] is "H" 
# word[2] is "R" 
# word[3] is "I" 
# word[4] is "S" 
# word[5] is "T" 
# word[6] is "M" 
# word[7] is "A" 
# word[8] is "S" 

# reversed_word = word[8]+word[7]+word[6]+word[5]+word[4]+word[3]+word[2]+word[1]+word[0]
# print(reversed_word)

word="Christmas"
reversed_word= word[len(word) -1]
print=reversed_word
